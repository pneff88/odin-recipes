This project consists of the basic files for a recipe website. 

In this project I will demonstrate elementary HTML competence including:
-basic HTML boilerplate
-HTML headings
-HTML paragraphs
-HTML images, including alternate text
-HTML links

I will also use this project to practice my skills in syncing the project with my github account
and in using git.

Followup reflection:
